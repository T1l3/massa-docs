Massa's decentralized web
#########################


Massa’s decentralized web allows you to store websites directly on the blockchain. This feature enables a lot of applications and provides another layer of security to your dApps.

This section introduces all steps to host your website on the blockchain and register it on Massa’s DNS service, in order to access it using any traditional browser.

To do so you will need to follow 3 simple steps: 

1. Install Thyra on your machine
2. Create a wallet
3. Define your DNS & upload your website on the blockchain

For each of the steps above, you will have the choice to do it manually or automatically via Thyra.


*What is Thyra*
===============

θύρα to pronounce thùra and to write Thyra is way simpler that his name looks like! It means entrance, gateway in ancient greek. Thyra is thus a gateway to Massa blockchain.

Thyra has been developed by Massa Labs to allow any type of users to participate, to create, and to access the blockchain flawlessly using classic web2 while assuring fully decentralised and secure transactions.

In the context of the decentralised web, Thyra acts as a Top Level Domain (TLD) that is redirecting users to the correct smart contract and address to access a specific website.

In a wider context, Thyra acts as a service enabler that will allow you to connect and perform all sorts of actions on the blockchain easily, without cutting security or integrity.
